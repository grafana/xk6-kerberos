# xk6-kerberos

k6 extension that adds support for [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos) authentication protocol. It adds a `k6/x/kerberos` JavaScript modules.

### JavaScript API

The extension exports a `UserClient` type usable for authenticate users over a Kerberos-secured environment.

```js
import { UserClient} `k6/x/kerberos`;

```

The client is expected to be instantiated by invoking its constructor passing through the Kerberos configuration.

```js
const kbClient = new UserClient(config, user.username, user.password, realm);

```

```
    const kbClient = new UserClient(krb5ini, user.username, user.password, realm);
    const token = kbClient.authenticate(service);
    session = token.negotiateHeader();

```

## Usage

To being able to use xk6-kerberos extension is required to build a new k6 binary. A detailed guide how to do it via a Docker or Go environment is available on the [extension's documentation](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/build-a-k6-binary-using-go/).


## Example

In [examples/krb5](./examples/krb5) a [fully working testing environment](./examples/krb5/docker-compose.yml) and a [simple example](./examples/script.js) are available to demostrate how to use the `k6/x/kerberos` module to authenticate against a Kerberos server and perform a request to service protected by Kerberos authentication.

### How to run

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine), or a compatible alternative, is required. Please, make sure to have it installed before to start.

Run locally the Kerberos' testing environment.

```sh
$ docker compose -f ./examples/gokrb5/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build a new k6 wit the Kerberos extension.

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/xk6 \
    grafana/xk6 build master \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-kerberos=.
```

> [!NOTE]  
> It uses the `master` branch as it uses the new `k6/experimental/fs` API. Soon avilable in v0.48.0 that isn't yet released.

Run the k6 test using the built binary.

```sh
docker run --rm -i \
  --network gokrb5_default \
  -v $(pwd)/k6:/usr/bin/k6 \
  -v $(pwd)/examples/gokrb5/krb5.conf:/home/k6/krb5.conf \
  grafana/k6:master run -<./examples/script.js
```

## Contribute

If you want to contribute or help with the development of xk6-kerberos, start by reading k6 [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Before you start coding, it might be a good idea to first discuss your plans and implementation details with the k6 maintainersâ€”especially when it comes to big changes and features. You can do this in the GitHub issue for the problem you're solving (create one if it doesn't exist).

## Development

The module is based on top of the [gokrb5](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5) library.
