# xk6-kerberos

k6 extension that adds support for [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos) authentication protocol. It adds a `k6/x/kerberos` JavaScript module.

### JavaScript API

The extension exports a `UserClient` type usable for authenticating a single user over a Kerberos-secured environment. Imports the library by its expected path `k6/x/kerberos`.

```js
import { UserClient} `k6/x/kerberos`;

```

The client is expected to be instantiated by invoking its constructor, passing through the Kerberos configuration and user credentials.

```js
const client = new UserClient(config, username, password, realm).
```

Check the table below to see the expected arguments:

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Configuration | ArrayBuffer | Yes | It contains the [Kerberos configuration](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html). Typically available in defined `krb5.conf` file. |
| Username      | string      | Yes | The user's username. |
| Password      | string      | Yes | The user's password. |
| Realm         | string      | No  | Optional. If not defined, it uses the default realm from config. |

When a client is initialized, then it can be used to get Kerberos service tickets.

```js
const token = client.authenticate(service);
```

The returned `session` can be used to generate the expected [SPNEGO](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4559#section-4.2) header to pass to HTTP services.

```js
const header = token.negotiateHeader();
```

It can be then used along the `k6/http` module to submit authenticated requests to an HTTP service.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

let headers = {Authorization: negotiateHeader};
http.get('http://test.k6.io', headers);
```

## Usage

Using the xk6-kerberos extension involves building a k6 binary incorporating it. A detailed guide on how to do this using a Docker or Go environment is available in the [extension's documentation](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/build-a-k6-binary-using-go/).

## Example

In [examples/krb5](./examples/krb5) a [fully working testing environment](./examples/krb5/docker-compose.yml) and a [simple example](./examples/script.js) are available to demonstrate how to use the `k6/x/kerberos` module to authenticate against a Kerberos server and perform a request to a service protected by Kerberos authentication.

### How to run

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine), or a compatible alternative, is required. Please make sure to have it installed before starting.

Run locally the Kerberos' testing environment.

```sh
$ docker compose -f ./examples/gokrb5/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build a new k6 binary incorporating the Kerberos extension.

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/xk6 \
    grafana/xk6 build master \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-kerberos=.
```

> [!NOTE]  
> It uses the `master` branch as it uses the new `k6/experimental/fs` API. Coming soon in v0.48.0, which has not yet been released.

Run the k6 test using the built binary.

```sh
docker run --rm -i \
  --network gokrb5_default \
  -v $(pwd)/k6:/usr/bin/k6 \
  -v $(pwd)/examples/gokrb5/krb5.conf:/home/k6/krb5.conf \
  grafana/k6:master run -<./examples/script.js
```

## Contribute

If you want to contribute or help with the development of xk6-kerberos, start by reading k6 [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  Before you start coding, it might be a good idea to discuss your plans and implementation details with the k6 maintainersâ€”especially regarding big changes and features. You can do this in the GitHub issue for the problem you're solving (create one if it doesn't exist).

## Development

The module is based on top of the [gokrb5](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5) library.
