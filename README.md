# xk6-kerberos

xk6-kerberos is an [extension for k6](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/). It adds support for the [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos) authentication protocol to k6, enabling you to perform tests on environments secured with [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos). 


```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import fs from 'k6/experimental/fs';
import kerberos from 'k6/x/kerberos';

// Open the Kerberos configuration file
let configFile;
(async function () {
	configFile = await open("krb5.conf");
})();

export default function() {
  // Read the content of the configuration file
  const config = await readAll(cfg); 

  // A UserClient can be used to authenticate a single user in a kerberos-secured environment.
  const client = new kerberos.UserClient(config, 'myusername', 'mypassword');

  // The authenticate method obtains a kerberos service ticket.
  const token = client.authenticate(service);

  // Which in turn can be used to generate a SPNEGO HTTP header to pass to
  // HTTP services.
  const negotiatedHeader = token.negotiateHeader();

  // Perform an authenticated request to a kerberos-secured HTTP service.
  http.get('https://test-api.k6.io', { Authorization: negociatedHeader });
}

// readAll is a helper function to read the whole content of a file into
// a Uint8Array buffer
async function readAll(file) {
  const finfo = await file.stat();
  const buffer = new Uint8Array(finfo.size+1);

	let bytesRead = await file.read(buffer);
	if (bytesRead !== finfo.size) {
		// we don't expect to have more or less to read
		// from the defined file size
		throw new Error("the read file doesn't match the expected size")
	}

	return buffer;
}
```

## Getting started

Using the xk6-kerberos extension involves building a k6 binary incorporating it. A detailed guide on how to do this using a Docker or Go environment is available in the [extension's documentation](https://k6.io/docs/extensions/guides/build-a-k6-binary-using-go/).

1. Build a k6 binary incorporating the xk6-kerberos extension
```bash
xk6 build --with github.com/grafana/xk6-kerberos=.
```

2. Run a test script with the newly built binary
```bash
./k6 run script.js
```

## Usage

Once [built](#getting-started) into a k6 executable using [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6), the extension can be imported by load test scripts as the `k6/x/kerberos` JavaScript module.

```javascript
import kerberos from 'k6/x/kerberos';
```

### UserClient

The module exports a `UserClient` type which can be used to authenticate a single user in a Kerberos-secured environment. Construct a `UserClient` instance by passing the Kerberos configuration and user credentials.

```js
const client = new UserClient(config, username, password, realm)
```

The table below details the expected arguments:

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| Configuration | ArrayBuffer | Yes | It contains the [Kerberos configuration](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html). Typically available in defined `krb5.conf` file. |
| Username      | string      | Yes | The user's username. |
| Password      | string      | Yes | The user's password. |
| Realm         | string      | No  | Optional. If not defined, it uses the default realm from config. |

An initialized client can then be used to get Kerberos service tickets.

```js
const token = client.authenticate(service);
```

The returned `session` can be used to generate the expected [SPNEGO](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4559#section-4.2) HTTP header to pass to HTTP services.

```js
const header = token.negotiateHeader();
```

It can be then used along the `k6/http` module to submit authenticated requests to an HTTP service.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

let headers = {Authorization: negotiateHeader};
http.get('http://test.k6.io', headers);
```

## Example

In [examples/krb5](./examples/krb5) a [fully working testing environment](./examples/krb5/docker-compose.yml) and a [simple example](./examples/script.js) are available to demonstrate how to use the `k6/x/kerberos` module to authenticate against a Kerberos server and perform a request to a service protected by Kerberos authentication.

### How to run

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine), or a compatible alternative, is required. Please make sure to have it installed before starting.

Run locally the Kerberos' testing environment.

```sh
$ docker compose -f ./examples/krb5/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build a new k6 binary incorporating the Kerberos extension.

```sh
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/xk6 \
    grafana/xk6 build master \
    --with github.com/grafana/xk6-kerberos=.
```

> [!NOTE]  
> It uses the `master` branch as it uses the new `k6/experimental/fs` API. Coming soon in v0.48.0, which has not yet been released.

Run the k6 test using the built binary.

```sh
docker run --rm -i \
  --network krb5_default \
  -v $(pwd)/k6:/usr/bin/k6 \
  -v $(pwd)/examples/krb5/krb5.conf:/home/k6/krb5.conf \
  -e KRB5_CONFIG=/home/k6/krb5.conf \
  grafana/k6:master run -<./examples/script.js
```

## Contribute

If you want to contribute or help with the development of xk6-kerberos, start by reading k6 [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  Before you start coding, it might be a good idea to discuss your plans and implementation details with the k6 maintainersâ€”especially regarding big changes and features. You can do this in the GitHub issue for the problem you're solving (create one if it doesn't exist).

## Development

The module is based on top of the [gokrb5](https://github.com/jcmturner/gokrb5) library.
